                  <p>In his tenure with ERC Amogh worked on various projects. The LED cube, Modbots, LED globe and Trotbot are some of his ventures. While being the chief coordinator, he mentored many of his juniors. In 2019 he finished his research thesis with the Georgia Institute of Technology (USA). He co-authored a research paper on control barrier functions(Synthesis of Control Barrier Functions Using a Supervised Machine Learning).
                     He is working at DreamVu.inc as Computer Vision Research fellow and at the moment his tasks include working on the calibration of the latest iteration of PAL - world's first 360° omnidirectional stereo and depth sensor, and deploying the camera for computer vision tasks like detection, tracking etc based on client requirements

                  <p>During his time with ERC Kapi worked a lot on legged robots and controls. He was a part of projects like Quadruped and Biped. With his keen interest in controls he went on to pursue his undergraduate thesis at NUS Biorobotics lab. His thesis was focused on making the hardware of a quadruped, and writing a controller for it based on the algorithms proposed by MIT Cheetah 3 paper - Whole Body Impulse Control and Model Predictive Control. Currently he is pursuing his MS from Johns Hopkins.

			      <h4>SWARMBOTS</h4>
			      <p>Swarm robotics is an approach to the coordination of multiple robots as a system which consists of large numbers of mostly simple physical robots.The project aimed at the task to automate a decentralized swarm of autonomous mobile robots to carry out different tasks.The system is completely decentralized. Each robot only knows its position and the position of the robots within a specific neighbourhood radius. The bots do not communicate with each other, and perform tasks through 'collective decision making' algorithms.This project was started by Rishikesh Vanarse in 2019. Multiple simulations have been created to perform tasks such as line formation, circle formation, etc. Along with this evaluation metrics were attached to each task to monitor the quality.

			      <p>LED Globe was the flagship display project from ERC for Quark 2019, the technical fest of BITS-Goa. The project lead was Mohit Gupta.
                  The globe consisted of two 75 cm radius acrylic semicircular discs having LEDs along the perimeter of one of them. This setup was mounted vertically on an aluminium frame. The setup would be rotated using a high torque motor. The synchronised firing of LEDs created the illusion of an image.
                  The programming that was involved allowed one to take any image from the internet, divide it into a number of segments which the code could recognize and thus program the LEDs in that manner.
